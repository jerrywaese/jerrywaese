- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jerrywaese
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the brain works, and I have been prototyping applications using JavaScript for years, and before that c++ etc.
- in this perception project, I am combining neurological findings with JavaScript to simulate my best understanding of how synchronous associative memory formation is 
achieved in the cerebral cortex, and how the perceptive reflex can cause memories to be associatively (re-)activated.
- Using the web browser console, it is possible to use this web page as a test harness, and I will do so to create a paper summarizing the findings.
- Next I want to add a few features to the cortical neuron object that will help suppress crosstalk and enable after-images as well as demonstrate short term memory's impact on perception.
- I would like to keep the project going by better simulating the thalamus and introducing the hypothalamus as well (allowing the focus of attention), and a more realistic "stream of consciousness". 
- and when I have a body idea for it I would add a hippocampus and brainstem as well.

Meantime, baby steps.
