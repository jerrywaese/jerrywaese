- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jerrywaese
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the brain works.
- I have been prototyping applications using JavaScript for years, and before that using c++ etc.
- In this perception project, I am combining neurological findings with JavaScript to simulate my best understanding of how synchronous associative memory formation is 
achieved in the cerebral cortex, and to simulate how the perceptive reflex associatively (re-)activates memories.
Both are one functional result - the former enabling the latter.
- Using the web browser console, it is possible to configure this web page as a test harness.
- 
- I would like to enable this Canvas based JavaScript project use live video to show some  "stream of consciousness" effects
.
